This is a public hosting of my A2 Computer Science project to create a platformer.
It is mostly here to provide the basis for the write-up section and is not meant to be complete software

This program uses [SFML 2.4.0](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) , [TinyXML2](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2) and the [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) map editor.sd
